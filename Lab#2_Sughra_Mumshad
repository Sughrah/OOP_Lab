 What Is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special function automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. Its primary role is to initialize the object's data members and allocate resources required for its operation. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

üîë Key Characteristics:
Automatic Invocation: Called automatically when an object is instantiated.

No Return Type: Does not return any value, not even void.

Overloading: Multiple constructors can exist with different parameter lists.

Encapsulation: Enables controlled initialization of objects.

üß± Types of Constructors in C++
1. Default Constructor
A constructor that takes no parameters. If no constructor is defined, the compiler provides a default one.

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code
    }
};
2. Parameterized Constructor
Accepts parameters to initialize an object with specific values.

class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(int val) {
        value = val;
    }
};
3. Copy Constructor
Creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(const MyClass &obj) {
        value = obj.value;
    }
};
4. Move Constructor
Transfers resources from a temporary object to a new object, avoiding deep copies.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(MyClass&& obj) {
        data = obj.data;
        obj.data = nullptr;
    }
};
üîÅ Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists, enabling objects to be initialized in various ways.

class MyClass {
public:
    int x, y;
    MyClass() {
        x = 0; y = 0;
    }
    MyClass(int a) {
        x = a; y = 0;
    }
    MyClass(int a, int b) {
        x = a; y = b;
    }
};
üßπ What Is a Destructor?
A destructor is a special member function invoked automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Its primary purpose is to release resources acquired by the object during its lifetime.

üîë Key Characteristics:
Automatic Invocation: Called automatically when an object is destroyed.

No Parameters: Cannot accept arguments.

No Return Type: Does not return any value.

No Overloading: Only one destructor per class.

Resource Cleanup: Used to release memory, close files, etc.

üîÑ Constructor vs. Destructor
Feature	Constructor	Destructor
Purpose	Initialize objects	Clean up before object destruction
Invocation	Automatically during object creation	Automatically during object destruction
Parameters	Can have parameters	Cannot have parameters
Return Type	None	None
Overloading	Allowed	Not allowed
Multiple per Class	Yes	No

üß† Why Use Constructors and Destructors?
Automatic Initialization: Ensure objects start in a valid state.

Resource Management: Acquire and release resources efficiently.

Code Clarity: Encapsulate setup and teardown logic within the class.

Error Prevention: Reduce the risk of uninitialized variables and resource leaks
